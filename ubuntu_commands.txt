INTRODUCTION:

Using Ubuntu on WSL2 allows you to:

	Run Linux commands (grep, sed, awk, vim, etc.).
	Install and use Linux development tools (Python, Node.js, Golang, etc.).
	Run Docker natively with systemd support.
	Use Bash scripts and automation.
	Access Windows files from Linux (/mnt/c/Users/...).
	Develop cross-platform applications easily.

Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) Using Ubuntu
	Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer in Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment (including 	command-line tools, utilities, and applications) directly on Windows without using a virtual machine (VM) or dual-boot setup.

WSL2 is the latest version of WSL, providing a more powerful and full-featured Linux experience on Windows.

In the context of an operating system (OS), a distro (short for distribution) refers to a specific version or variation of an OS, typically in the Linux and Unix ecosystem. A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, bundled with various software, tools, libraries, and a package management system.


Key Components of a Linux Distro:
Linux Kernel – The core part of the OS managing hardware and system processes.
Package Manager – Tools like apt (Debian-based) or dnf (Fedora-based) that manage software installation and updates.
Shell & Terminal – Command-line interfaces like Bash or Zsh.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE, or XFCE.
Pre-installed Software – Text editors, browsers, system utilities, etc.
System Utilities & Libraries – Essential components to run applications and services.

Popular Linux Distributions:
Debian-based:
Ubuntu
Linux Mint
Kali Linux
Red Hat-based:
Fedora
CentOS Stream
Rocky Linux
Arch-based:
Arch Linux
Manjaro
Others:
openSUSE
Slackware
Gentoo
Each distribution is tailored for different user needs—some focus on stability (Debian, CentOS), usability (Ubuntu, Mint), security (Kali Linux), or customization (Arch, Gentoo).

A Linux distribution (distro) is essentially a customized package of the Linux kernel along with system utilities, libraries, and applications that enable users to operate and interact with their computers efficiently. Let’s break down how a Linux distro works internally.

1. Core Components of a Linux Distro
	A Linux distro is built upon a structured hierarchy of components that work together to provide a functional operating system.

A. Linux Kernel (Core of the OS)
	The Linux kernel acts as the bridge between hardware and software.
	It handles process management, memory management, hardware drivers, and system security.
	Distros might use different kernel versions and apply custom patches for performance or security enhancements.
B. Init System (Boot & Service Management)
	The init system is responsible for booting up the OS and managing background services (daemons).
	Common init systems:
		systemd (Most modern distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
		SysVinit (Older systems)
		OpenRC (Gentoo, Alpine Linux)

C. Shell & Command Line Interface (CLI)
	The shell provides an interface for interacting with the OS.
	Common shells:
		Bash (Most common)
		Zsh (Popular alternative)
		Fish, Tcsh
D. Filesystem Hierarchy
	Linux distros follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
	/ (root) - Base of the file system
	├── /bin - Essential command binaries
	├── /etc - System configuration files
	├── /home - User directories
	├── /lib - Essential libraries
	├── /usr - User applications and utilities
	├── /var - Logs, caches, temporary files
	├── /dev - Hardware devices (block storage, USB, etc.)
	├── /proc - System and process information
	├── /sys - Kernel and system info
	└── /tmp - Temporary files
E. Package Management System
	Distros include a package manager to install, update, and remove software.
	Different distros use different package managers:
		Debian-based: dpkg, apt
		RedHat-based: dnf, rpm
		Arch-based: pacman
		Gentoo: portage
	Packages are stored in repositories (repos), which contain pre-compiled software.
F. Desktop Environment (GUI)
	Provides a graphical interface for users who don’t prefer CLI.
	Common desktop environments:
		GNOME (Fedora, Ubuntu)
		KDE Plasma (Kubuntu, Manjaro KDE)
		XFCE, LXDE, Cinnamon, MATE (Lightweight options)

2. How a Linux Distro Works Step-by-Step
	A. Boot Process
		BIOS/UEFI initializes the hardware.
		Bootloader (GRUB, systemd-boot, LILO) loads the Linux kernel.
		Kernel initializes system hardware and mounts the root filesystem.
		Init system (systemd) starts background services (networking, logging, display server).
		Login prompt appears (CLI or graphical interface).
	B. Process Management
		The kernel schedules processes and allocates CPU time.
		Processes can be:
			Foreground (e.g., running a command in terminal)
			Background (Daemon/Service) (e.g., SSH server, Apache web server)
	C. User and Permissions
		Linux is a multi-user OS:
			Root (Administrator)
			Regular users
			Groups for permission management
		The permissions system controls file access (rwx for read, write, execute).
	D. Filesystem Management
		Everything in Linux is treated as a file (including devices like /dev/sda1).
		Uses different filesystems like:
			ext4 (default in most distros)
			XFS, Btrfs, ZFS (advanced features)
	E. Networking
		Network interfaces are managed via:
			NetworkManager (GUI & CLI)
			ifconfig/ip (CLI)
		Supports networking protocols:
			TCP/IP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc.
		Uses firewalls (iptables, firewalld, UFW) for security.

It returns the name of the init system running on the machine. Possible outputs include:

	init → If using SysVinit.
	systemd → If using systemd (modern Ubuntu versions).
	busybox or runit → If using a lightweight init system.
	upstart → If using Upstart (older Ubuntu versions).



1. Create mockoon into Ubuntu subsystem: docker run -d --name response_updated_pocket_sucessful --mount type=bind,source=/mnt/c/practice_test/LocalEnviroment/edit_pocket_succesful_mock.json,target=/data/,readonly -p 3001:3001 mockoon/cli:latest --data /data --port 3001

2. Start Docker: systemctl start docker or sudo systemctl start docker
3. Get docker info: docker info
4. Execute file: sh /mnt/c/banco/distribution_router/superApp/init.sh or sh init.sh
5. Update docker in Ubunto: sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -	m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
6.To check if systemd is working, run: ps --no-headers -o comm 1
7. systemctl start apache2
8. systemctl stop MySQL
9. systemctl restart nginx
10. systemctl list-units --type=service
11. systemctl poweroff
12. write on location: echo -e "[boot]\nsystemd=true" | sudo tee -a /etc/wsl.conf: echo= enable newline. tee= appends (-a) the text to 	/etc/wsl.conf while 							using sudo
13. Open the file in the nano editor: sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
14. Restart WSL: wsl
15. Verify if systemd is running: systemctl list-units --type=service
16. Install dependencies: sudo apt install wsl
17. wsl --install
18. wsl --list --online
19. install ubuntu into Windows: wsl --install -d Ubuntu
20. Install WSL2 by default: wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2 (and) wsl --set-default-version 2
21. check wsl: wsl --list --verbose
22. Open Ubuntu from the Start menu or Windows Terminal: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
23. To check if you're running WSL2: uname -r
24. Edit the WSL config file: sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf (and adding text)
25. restar WSL: wsl --shutdown
26. Verify systemd is running: systemctl list-units --type=service

INSIDE WSL UBUNTU, YOU CAN ACCESS YOUR WINDOWS FILES AT:
27. ACCESS WINDOWS FILE: cd /mnt/c/ 
28. See folder: ls
29. To See if file is accesible: ls -l /mnt/c/practice_test/LocalEnvironment/
30. See permisión: ls -l /mnt/c/file
31. Amend mode permition: chmod +r /mnt/c/banco/practice_test/LocalEnvironment/edit_pocket_succesful_mock.json
32. Init docker into Ubuntu: sudo systemctl start docker
33. Init docker into Ubuntu by default: sudo systemctl enable docker
34. to see content into file wsl.conf using Ubuntu: cat /etc/wsl.conf
35. /mnt/: is a mounting from windows file. Embebbed system ubuntu into Windows.
